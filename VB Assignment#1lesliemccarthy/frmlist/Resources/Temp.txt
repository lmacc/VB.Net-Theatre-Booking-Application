Ben and Holly's Little Kingdom Somewhere, hidden amongst the thorny brambles is a little kingdom where everyone is very very small. From the makers of Peppa Pig comes this BAFTA Award-winning television animation for the first time ever live on stage! Holly is a young Fairy Princess, who is still learning how to fly and her magic doesn't always go quite according to plan. Her best friend, Ben the Elf, doesn't have wings and he doesn't do magic, but he runs very fast and flies on the back of Gaston the Ladybird. They live in the Little Kingdom, a tiny land where flowers and grass rise high above them and every day is an adventure.
